# JMB Basic Swap Toggle
A very simple agent to toggle the default swapping of the JMB Basic Window Layout

Note: This agent doesn't have any effect if you don't use the JMB Basic Window Layout

Installation : Download [zip package](https://github.com/NadiGames/JMB-Basic-Swap-Toggle/blob/main/NG%20Swap%20Toggle.1.0.zip), and drop the content in your JMB Agents folder.
Restart JMB, that's all.
